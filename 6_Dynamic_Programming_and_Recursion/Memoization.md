Memoization
===========

Memoization ensures that a function doesn't run for the same inputs more than once by keeping a record of the results for the given inputs (usually in a dictionary).

Memoization is a common strategy for dynamic programming problems, which are problems where the solution is composed of solutions to the same problem with smaller inputs (as with the Fibonacci problem, above). 

The other common strategy for dynamic programming problems is going bottom-up, which is usually cleaner and often more efficient.
