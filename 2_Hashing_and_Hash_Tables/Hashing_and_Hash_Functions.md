Hashing and Hash Functions
==========================

A **hash function** takes data and outputs a _hash_, a fixed-size string or number

- It can be thought of as a "fingerprint"
- We cannot go from hash back to the original file
- Case when multiple files habe the same hash value, it is called a **hash collision**
