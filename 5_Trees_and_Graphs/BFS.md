Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal
==========

- method for exploring a tree or graph. 
- first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc.

Steps:
1. Start with root
2. Visit immediate children (all nodes that are one step away from our starting node)
3. Then we'd move on to all those nodes' children
4. And so on...

Advantages
----------
- will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node

Disadvantages
-------------
- generally required more memory than a DFS
